# ps5-price-tracker
# amazon price and availability tracker for ps5
In this little python script, I tried to automated the process of checking the availability of PS5 (or any other product) and send an email in case the product is available.
The project uses firefox webdriver (included in the repo). In case there were problems with the driver, consider updating the webdriver to the version of your firefox.
After clonening the repo:
  cd path/you/cloned/to
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python tracker.py
